# 👋 Hi, I'm Abel Gedle  

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

Passionate about **📊 Data Analysis, 💼 Business Analysis, 🌐 Digital Solutions, and 📚 Educator**. 

I am a Data Analytics professional with a strong foundation in statistics, visualization, and problem-solving.                                    
Trained under a Data Analytics Masters program - Certified in Data Visualization with Python (IBM Developer Skills Network).

Alongside Data Analytics, I bring in Accounting (8+ years), Project Management (PMP Basics), and multilingual communication skills                                                                                           — A background that makes my approach to data precise, versatile, and detail-oriented. 
                                    

🎯 My artist’s mindset in painting, sculpture, and design sharpens my ability to see patterns, simplify complexity, and tell stories with data.
